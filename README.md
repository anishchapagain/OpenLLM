# GenAI and LLM Repository

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks related to General Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLM).

## Overview
- **Prompt**: Tutorials and crash course related to Prompt Engineering.
- **GenAI**: General Artificial Intelligence refers to AI systems that can perform tasks across a wide range of domains, often integrating multiple modalities such as text, image, and speech.
- **LLM**: Large Language Models are AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.
- **Agentic AI**: Agentic AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can make decisions and take actions independently. It can also adapt to new information and collaborate with humans to solve problems. 
- **Mistral AI**: Frontier AI in your hands.
- **Langchain**: LangChain is a composable framework to build with LLMs. https://www.langchain.com
- **RAG**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines LLMs with external knowledge bases to improve their outputs.
- **Gemini**: **Bard** is now Gemini. Get help with writing, planning, learning, and more from **Google AI**. https://gemini.google.com/
